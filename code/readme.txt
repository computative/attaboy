This is the collection of code which will reproduce all results from project 4. Some items are written in R, this does not apply to anything which was mandatory to produce. All the obligatory results can be obtained from the *.py files which typically run a executable where the source code is included along with the executable. In the cases where the *.py does not run an executable, it will sometimes load data from the ../resources directory. These were files which were computed using the items in directory /code/cluster_job. These has to be ran on smaug because they will typically take 15 hours to complete on 248 cores. In the cluster_job directory, the jobs.py create 31 jobs, each running the script runIsing.py. These will produce the data in the resource directory. All the 400MB of data which was gathered in its final format is present in the resource file for your reference.

The *.py-files produce all the plots which are present in the benchmark directory upon execution.
